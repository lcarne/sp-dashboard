# Dashboard Plugin for Super Productivity

A lightweight dashboard plugin for [Super Productivity](https://super-productivity.com) that visualizes time tracked, completed tasks, overdue items, and project breakdowns within a user‑defined date range. It ships as a self-contained HTML/JavaScript widget with no external dependencies and is styled to support light/dark themes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Selectable date ranges: past week, month, year or custom range
- Two views:
  - **Dashboard** with key metrics, bar charts and pie charts
  - **Detailed list** of individual time entries and task status

## 🖼️ Preview

Below are screenshots of the plugin rendered outside of the host app (mock data is used when `PluginAPI` is not available):

![Dashboard View](assets/dashboard.png)
*Dashboard with key metrics and charts.*

![Detailed List View](assets/detailed_list.png)
*Detailed list of individual time entries and task statuses.*

![Settings View](assets/settings.png)
*Settings panel - configure chart grouping, date formats, and project breakdown options.*

*(Images are regenerated via the screenshot utility when the UI changes.)*

- Native charts rendered with vanilla JS and CSS (no charting libraries)
- Responsive layout and theming consistent with Super Productivity
- Live updates when task data changes in the host app
- Fallback mock data for standalone development and screenshots

└── index.test.js         # Vitest/JSDOM unit tests

Makefile                 # Build & release helpers
package.json             # Node tooling and dependencies

> All plugin logic resides in a single HTML file to conform with the host app's plugin sandbox.

## 📦 Installation

1. Download the plugin files for the latest [Release](https://github.com/dougcooper/sp-dashboard/releases)
2. Open Super Productivity
3. Go to Settings → Plugins
4. Click "Load Plugin from Folder"
5. Select the `sp-dashboard` zip file
6. The plugin will be activated automatically

---

## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (18+) and npm/yarn installed
- `make` available (macOS/Linux)

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Running tests

```bash
npm test          # run once
npm run test:watch # watch mode
npm run test:coverage # generate coverage report
# or simply
make test
```

### Updating the screenshots

The screenshots are stored under `assets/` and are tracked with Git LFS. You can regenerate them with:

```bash
npm run screenshot   # uses puppeteer, outputs images
# or
make screenshot
```


The tests load `index.html` via JSDOM and manually execute the embedded script. They cover utility functions, metric calculations, and basic UI interactions.

### Building for release

```bash
make
#or
make build        # compiles plugin into /build/sp-dashboard zip ready for distribution
```

`make release` performs additional steps (tagging, GitHub release) and requires the GitHub CLI.

## 📝 Usage Notes

- The plugin listens for Redux `ACTION` hooks from Super Productivity and posts a message to the iframe to refresh whenever the app state changes.
- If the PluginAPI is unavailable (e.g. opening `index.html` directly in a browser), mock data is injected after a short timeout to make development easier.
- Charts are rendered using CSS and DOM elements; they automatically bucket data if the date range contains more than 30 days.

---

## ✅ Testing Guidelines

- Add new unit tests for every new feature or logic change.
- Mock `PluginAPI` where necessary using `vi.stubGlobal` or manual objects.
- Cover edge cases such as empty date ranges, tasks without projects, overdue detection, and date manipulation.
